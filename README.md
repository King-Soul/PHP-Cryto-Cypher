** SIMPLE SYSTEM FOCUSING ON PASSWORD ENCRYPTION AND SECURE LOGIN METHODS **

This is a simple sistem in PHP that let you cypher all the users passwords.

All the passwords are being encrypted with a Secret key that will be generated automatically in the future.
This sistem doesnt decrypt any of the password, when its needed to compare any password in the database to find some user it will compare the encrypted password
Ex: When you login after you enter the password, that password will be encrypted and then it will compare in the database.
